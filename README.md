# Overview

For this program, I wanted to demonstrate the Rust language as I continue on my journey to learn different programming languages. For this, I created a program that would work as a potential POS (Point of Service)/register in a restaurant. Using multiple different parts, including entrees, sides, and sauces, the program successfully builds meals using the struc object to retain relevant information to that meal. This program uses a variety of mutable and immutable variables, many different data collection methods, conditional statements, loops and for loops, functional programming, and multiple other programming methods, objects, and techniques.

I wrote this software to demonstrate the usefulness of Rust in the creation of a POS in a restaurant. I created my own "restaurant" to demonstrate some of the capabilities I could achieve.

# Development Environment

To write this code, I used Visual Studio Code and the [rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) to aid in constructing and compiling code.

The programming language used for this program is Rust. This program uses the std libraries of io, thread, str, and time.

# Future Work

- Compress the meal size by counting the different parts of each meal and putting a number after them instead of printing out the full list of items even with repetition.
- Add additional options by increasing the Menu size and implementing further code to allow for different food types (e.g. drinks, individual and bulk sauces, etc.).
- Make the user interface more user-friendly by adding GUI components.
